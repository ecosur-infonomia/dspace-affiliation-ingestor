    <abstract xmlns="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">Dispersed repeat elements contribute to
        genome instability by de novo insertion
        and unequal recombination between
        repeats. To study the dynamics of these
        processes, we have developed single DNA
        molecule approaches to detect de novo
        insertions at a single locus and
        Alu-mediated deletions at two different
        loci in human genomic DNA. Validation
        experiments showed these approaches
        could detect insertions and deletions at
        frequencies below 10(-6) per cell.
        However, bulk analysis of germline
        (sperm) and somatic DNA showed no
        evidence for genuine mutant molecules,
        placing an upper limit of insertion and
        deletion rates of 2 x 10(-7) and 3 x
        10(-7), respectively, in the individuals
        tested. Such re-arrangements at these
        loci therefore occur at a rate lower
        than that detectable by the most
        sensitive methods currently available.
